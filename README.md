# **Multi-Modal ECG Digitization**

## **Overview**
The `model_train.py` script is a **multi-input deep learning training pipeline** designed for **ECG signal reconstruction** using paired **ECG images and signals**. This model follows a **multi-modal learning approach**, where **ECG waveforms from printed images are fused with their corresponding digital signals** to reconstruct an accurate and noise-free ECG.

## **ðŸš€ The Power of Fusing ECG Signals and Images**
Traditional ECG analysis relies on **either raw signals** (from electrodes) or **visual ECG printouts** (from medical records). However, **each modality alone has limitations**:

- **ECG Images**:  
  - Contain **waveform shape** but may suffer from **grid artifacts, noise, and distortions**.  
  - Important in cases where **digital ECG signals are unavailable** (e.g., scanned medical records).
- **Raw ECG Signals**:  
  - Provide **precise electrical activity** but might be **missing important shape features** if preprocessing removes critical aspects.  

ðŸ”‘ **By fusing these two sources (image + signal), the model enhances ECG reconstruction accuracy.**  
âœ… **The image provides waveform structure**, helping the model **recover missing or distorted regions**.  
âœ… **The signal ensures precision**, correcting any distortions in the image-based interpretation.  
âœ… **Combining both improves digitization**, allowing the reconstruction of a **faithful, clinically meaningful ECG**.
